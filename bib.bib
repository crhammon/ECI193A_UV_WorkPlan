abstract="Despite technological advances in water and wastewater treatments, contaminated water is still an important vehicle of transmission for enteric pathogens of humans and animals. Untreated waters are normally discharged into surface waters. Proper disinfection treatment is extremely vital for reducing a large number of microorganisms present in wastewater. With proper disinfection, microorganism level in wastewater can be reduced to a safe level, allowing for wastewater to be reused in applications such as agricultural and urban irrigation without compromising on human health. Therefore, this study was developed to investigate the UV (ultraviolet) disinfection performance toward different microbial pathogens and evaluate the effectiveness of UV reactor in wastewater disinfection in Egypt. Low-intensity UV light was tested with different wastewater qualities to determine the variability of factors governing UV disinfection process in relation to bacterial types; also, compare the UV sensitivity of different microbial pathogens and fecal indicators to achieve the safe dose for wastewater disinfection, which could prevent the extent of (dark photo) repair in fecal indicators and pathogens after UV exposure; and investigate the suitable water characteristics for UV application to meet the allowable limits. It could be concluded that principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that each bacterial group has specific sensitivity and its inactivation is governed by different water characteristics in the UV reactor. VSS, TSS, and TDS of the wastewater were found to have the greatest effect on UV disinfection efficiency. UV dose was 5,305.2Â mw/cm2Â s. Streptococci showed no repair for both dark and light, but fecal coliform and Vibrio cholerae showed little repair for dark and light. Salmonella and Shigella displayed more increase in dark and light than control samples. Photoreactivation was higher than dark repair. In relation to Salmonella and Shigella, a significant increase in the bacterial count in light repair is observed, that every cell (colony-forming unit) remained after UV exposure multiplied to 122Â cfu in light repair.",

title="Design and optimization of open-channel water ultraviolet disinfection reactor",
journal="Chemical Papers",
year="2019",
month="Jan",
day="29",
abstract="Design and optimization have developed gradually from a methodology for academic attraction into a technology that has made a significant impact on the industrial growth. A careful and well-optimized design of open-channel water ultraviolet (UV) disinfection reactor ensures the achievement of minimum UV dose required, as well as allowing the minimum operational costs. Such UV reactors are mostly utilized in water treatment plants throughout the world to provide the system for disinfecting the drinking water. Yet, at present, lack of rigorous quantitative understanding of behavior in such reactor geometries is shown to limit the versatile and efficient optimization of UV reactor. A new UV reactor design concept is essential that should be able to consider the three significant parameters, namely: uniform UV light propagation within the open-channel UV reactor, providing optimum lamp positioning within the volume of the UV reactor and should allow optimum flow rate of the water. It is approved that computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation can be used as a quick and cheap means for design and optimization of water disinfection UV reactor. A novel design and optimization approach which combines CFD modeling, design of experiment (DOE), response surface method (RSM) and goal-driven optimization (GDO) was presented for open-channel water UV disinfection reactor. This methodology includes a heuristic approach from scratch to the final optimal solution. The optimal design variables which have the optimum value of the object functions were identified through proposed methodology. The results showed that the CFD method can be employed for estimation of the optimum design, even though the shape of the open-channel UV reactor is complex. The CFD results reveal that the UV dose distribution and flow of water were largely dependent on the lamp positioning. This paper demonstrates that UV reactor optimization in conceptual design is possible using a commercial CFD package. As a conclusion, the proposed design and optimization technique based on DOE, RSM and GDO could be a suitable technique prior to a final design of open-channel water UV disinfection reactor.",
